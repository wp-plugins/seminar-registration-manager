== Description ==

Seminar Registration Manager is a plugin that allows users who hold seminars to place a registration form on their site, as well as manage their registrants. Admins can create coupon codes for discounts for the seminar, and registrants can register additional registrants in a single transaction. This plugin currently requires Authorize.net or PayPal Website Payments Pro for payment processing. In the future, additional payment options will be added.

== Installation ==

1. Create any coupon codes that you might want to use.
1. Place the [srm_register] short code on any page or post, which will serve as a registration page.
