== Description ==



Seminar Registration Manager is a plugin that allows users who hold seminars to place a registration form on their site, as well as manage their registrants. Admins can create coupon codes for discounts for the seminar, and registrants can register additional registrants in a single transaction. This plugin currently requires Authorize.net or PayPal Website Payments Pro for payment processing. In the future, additional payment options will be added.



== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or upload it automatically.

1. Under the Seminar Registration Manager tab in the admin area, visit the Settings page and configure the settings for your specific use.

1. Create at least one seminar on the Add/Edit Seminar page.

1. Create any coupon codes that you might want to use.

1. Place the [srm_register] short code on any page or post, which will serve as a registration page.

1. Now it should be ready to use! You can manage your registrants from the back end.
