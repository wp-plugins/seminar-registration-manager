    <div class="srm-content">
        Thank you for checking out Seminar Registration Manager. This plugin allows you to have visitors to your site register for seminars, and complete the payment on your site. You'll want to be sure that you have an SSL certificate enabled for the site, and be sure all registration pages are secure. There is a <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-https/" target="_blank">good plugin</a> for this available.
        <p>
            I don't have complete documentation or anything yet, but check out what I do have, and then hopefully you can find your way around from there.
        </p>
        <h2>Documentation</h2>
        <h3>Basic Usage</h3>
        <ul>
